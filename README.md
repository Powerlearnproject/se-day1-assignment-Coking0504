#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
- reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
- efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
- scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
- security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.




Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering has evolved significantly over the decades. Here are three key milestones in its development:

-  The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at a NATO conference in 1968. This milestone marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline rather than an ad-hoc programming activity. The conference aimed to address the "software crisis," where projects were increasingly failing due to poor planning, inefficiencies, and lack of structured methodologies.
- The Development of Structured Programming (1970s)
In response to software complexity, structured programming was introduced as a paradigm to improve code readability and maintainability. This approach, championed by Edsger Dijkstra and others, emphasized control structures such as loops, conditionals, and modularization. This led to better organization of software projects and influenced later methodologies like object-oriented programming.
  - The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marked a shift from heavyweight, document-driven development (like Waterfall) to more iterative, flexible processes. Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban, focus on collaboration, continuous delivery, and responding to change. This milestone revolutionized software development, making it more adaptive to customer needs and technological advancements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Planning involves identifying the software requirement , purpose and scope.
 - Requirement analysis requires identifying the final user specification. 
- Design  this is building the framework. 
- Coding involves converting software design into tangible code.
- Testing to examine the software for any bugs and glitches



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
- discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
- create blueprint for the project.
- tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
- deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and VCS are essential tools that enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality in software development. the following are their importances:

Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Software testing ensures that a system functions correctly, meets requirements, and is free of critical defects. The primary types of testing include unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing, each serving a specific purpose in the development lifecycle.

- Unit Testing
Definition:

Involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
Usually performed by developers using automated testing frameworks.
Purpose:

Ensures that each unit (e.g., function, class, module) works as expected.
Helps catch bugs early in development, reducing debugging costs later.
Example Tools:

JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), NUnit (.NET)
Importance:

Improves code reliability and maintainability.
Simplifies debugging by identifying errors at the smallest level.
-  Integration Testing
Definition:

Tests the interaction between integrated modules to ensure they work together correctly.
Purpose:

Detects issues in data flow and communication between components.
Ensures that APIs, databases, and third-party services integrate correctly.
Types:

Top-down integration (testing starts with the main module and integrates downward).
Bottom-up integration (lower-level modules are tested first and integrated upward).
Example Tools:

Postman (API testing), JUnit (Java with integration testing), TestNG
Importance:

Identifies issues that unit tests might miss, such as data inconsistencies or interface mismatches.
-  System Testing
Definition:
Tests the entire software application as a whole in a real-world environment.
Purpose:
Ensures that all modules work together as expected in the final system.
Verifies performance, security, and usability aspects.
Example Tools:
Selenium (automated UI testing), JMeter (performance testing), LoadRunner
Importance:
Validates that the software meets technical, functional, and business requirements.
- Acceptance Testing
Definition:
Determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Often conducted by end-users or clients.
Types:
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Performed by end-users to validate functionality.
Alpha Testing: Conducted internally before releasing to external users.
Beta Testing: Involves external users testing in a real-world environment before final release.
Example Tools:
TestRail (test case management), Cucumber (behavior-driven testing)
Importance:
Ensures that the software is usable and meets customer expectations before release.
Reduces post-deployment issues and ensures customer satisfaction.
Each type of testing plays a critical role in software quality assurance. Unit testing catches bugs early, integration testing ensures components work together, system testing validates the full application, and acceptance testing confirms business requirements are met. A comprehensive testing strategy enhances reliability, user experience, and overall software quality.








#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
- Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
- Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
- Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the - 
  Large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
- Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
- Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
- Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
